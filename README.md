# BitToWordApp
Python for converting bits set for a 32 bit register into a hex value.

This program was written in its entirety by the Google Gemini LLM AI.  I have put an MIT license on it.

I created this program because I write embedded software and often have to fill in individual bits on hundreds of registers as defined in user manuals of thousands of pages.  Rather than do the whole Reg=(1<<0) | (1<< 25).. stuff to set up a register I wanted a program like this.

I first thought I should write one and do it in Python.  Then I said to myself "Self, why not try one of those AI things?"  So I did.  I used the Google one because Google does some fine work!  A single line of text and it coughed up the code presented here.

I am gobsmacked!  What a time saver!
